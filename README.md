# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI

This project focuses on the prediction of Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice features. It implements supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) alongside Explainable AI (XAI) tools such as SHAP and LIME to ensure transparency and interpretability in healthcare diagnostics.

   - Train-Test Split

2. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest
   - SVM (with hyperparameter tuning)

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

4. **Model Explainability**
   - SHAP for global and instance-level feature importance
   - LIME for local prediction interpretation

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

Given the critical nature of healthcare applications, we integrated XAI techniques:
- **SHAP:** Quantifies the impact of each feature on the model’s prediction.
- **LIME:** Explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally.
